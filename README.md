# CookieManager
CookieManager is a JavaScript module that helps manage cookies as name it covers >:-)!

_I looked for simple script that haven't requires code like jQuery. I know, almost everybody loves jQuery! Me too! But I needed tool for core JavaScript. That I found was terrible and wrote my own code. Hope that you can enjoy of using it ;-)_

## Getting stared
* Copy main file - CookieManager.js - from dist folder.
* Paste it somewere in your project.
* Simple put <script type="text/javascript" src="{path/to/CookieManager.js}"></script> in your code or copy code to some JavaScript file where you have all scripts.
* do var cm = new CookieManager(configObject)
* then you can use methods like .get(), .set() and .delete() on that variable, what I hoping know that ;-)
